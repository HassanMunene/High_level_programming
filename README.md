 ## Zen of Python

* Beautifule is better than ugly

* Explicit is better than implicit

* Simple is better than complex
* Flat is bette than nested
* Sparce is better than dense
* Readability counts
* Special cases are not special enought to break the rules
* Although practicality beats purity
* Errors should never pass silently unless explicitly silenced
* In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to to guess
* There should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it. Although that may not be the obvious at first unless you are Dutch. Now is better than ever
* Although never is often better than **right** now
* If the implementation is hard to explain, it is a bad idea
* If the implementation is easy to explain it may be a good idea
* Namespaces are one honking great idea --lets do more of those
