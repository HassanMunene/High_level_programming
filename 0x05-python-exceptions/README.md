This is a directory in which we are dealing with python exceptions and errors.
Exceptions occurs when you try an error is experienced when the program is running 
which halts the execution of the program.
we use exceptions in code that we are not sure about how they are gonna react when running 
and therefore throw an exception to counter any or a specific type of an error.
