# Introduction to SQL 

When we will be making applications we will require a place where we can store the data

Data will be stored in a database and the way to communicate, manipulate, and retrieve this data we require a language
that will be able to communicate with the database, just like how we need a programming language to give a computer instructions we also a specific tool that can communicate with database.

This language is called STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE(SQL). 

The type of database is used to manipulate is called a relational database, as it made up of tables that are somehow connected.
